I am currently an assistant professor at the School of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development, Renmin University of China. My research mainly focuses on environmental economics (with a particular interest in climate change) and applied econometrics.

P.S. This website is still being updated though not as frequently as before. Most of the updates lie in the data sections. Hope that saves you some time from data searching.
