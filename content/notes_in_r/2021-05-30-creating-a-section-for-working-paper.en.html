<p>I spent quite some time figuring out how to present publications and working papers independently in separate sections. Most importantly, Iâ€™d like working papers to be displayed in the same format as a publication. See examples on my website.</p>
<p>However, it turned out not easy. I first created a <code>workingpaper.md</code> file in the <code>home</code> folder and set the <code>page_type = "publication"</code>. Simoutaounsly, I created a new folder named <code>workingpaper</code> to store the working papers. After deployment, the website ended up displaying publications in the <code>publication</code> folder instead of the working papers in the newly created <code>working paper</code> folder.</p>
<p>I further explored by changing the <code>page_type = "workingpaper"</code>. This time the working papers were displayed on the website. The problem was that they displayed as a post NOT in a publication format.</p>
<p>I thus posted this question in the discussion section of the <code>wowchemy</code>. See the original <a href="https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/discussions/2298#discussioncomment-765481">post</a>. The problem was solved perfectly.</p>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a new <code>workingpaper.md</code> file in <code>./content/home/</code> folder (you can simply copy the <code>publications.md</code> file and rename it). In the <code>workingpaper.md</code> file, set <code>page_type = "publication"</code> and also set <code>content.filter.publication_type = "3"</code> (<strong>This is important!!</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Go to <code>./content/home/publications.md</code> and set <code>content.filter.publication_type = "2"</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Import pulications and working papers in the <code>./content/publication/</code> folder (following this <a href="https://www.yabin-da.com/notes_in_r/blogdownwebsite/#add-publications-to-your-website">post</a> to import). Simply set the <code>publication_types: ["2"]</code> or <code>publication_types: ["3"]</code> in the associated <code>index.md</code> file for that publication/working paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy the website. We are all set!</p></li>
</ul>
