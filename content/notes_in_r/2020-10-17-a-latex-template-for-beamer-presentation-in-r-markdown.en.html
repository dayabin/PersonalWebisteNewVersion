<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I really like beamer presentations (slides) in the LaTex manner. It’s very neat and looks pretty professional. These beamer presentations are particularly preferable in academics.</p>
<p>There is no need for you to build a LaTex beamer from the very beginning. Plenty of templates are available, just GOOGLE it. You may even find templates that are officially provided by your university.</p>
<p>The advantage of LaTex is that it’s very flexible, yet sometimes maybe too flexible and difficult to pick up for beginners. So I decided to move to R Markdown which I am more familiar with and I think is easier than LaTex.</p>
<p>The problem with R Markdown beamer is that the official cookbook only covers limited features. In most cases, it’s better to use a LaTex <strong>template</strong> to start with in R Markdown. In this way, you can do all the fancy customization in the LaTex template and in R Markdown you just fill the content of your slides.</p>
<p>I found this nice LaTex template developed by <a href="http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/02/svm-r-markdown-manuscript/">Dr. Steven V. Miller</a>. He eliminated unnecessary navigation and blank lines to make the best use of available spaces. From his website, you can learn how to customize the template based on your needs.</p>
</div>
<div id="download-the-tamu-template" class="section level3">
<h3>Download the TAMU template</h3>
<p>Here from my <a href="https://github.com/dayabin/TAMUBeamer">Github</a>, you can directly download the TAMU template with maroon color and TAMU logo (<code>TAMUTemplate.tex</code>). You can also find an example of TAMU beamer presentation there (<code>TAMUBeamer.pdf</code>).</p>
<p>Below I will briefly introduce the changes I made to Dr. Miller’s original template. Before you start your editing, you are recommended to quickly go over the template to have a basic idea of what’s going on there.</p>
</div>
<div id="include-tamu-logo" class="section level3">
<h3>Include TAMU LOGO</h3>
<p>You may want to include TAMU logo in your title page of your slide. Information about TAMU branding, including logo, color, font, etc. can be found from <a href="https://brandguide.tamu.edu/visual-style/logos/downloads.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To include, go to the template and navigate to the code section like below. Here I use an absolute path. You just need to replace with paths on your local machine.</p>
<pre><code>
\titlegraphic{\includegraphics[width=0.4\paperwidth]{C:/work/TAMUBeamer/tamu/tamu.png}} 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="maroon-color" class="section level3">
<h3>Maroon color</h3>
<p>To customize colors in the template, you can go to the code section below. I define two colors, <code>tamumaroon</code> and <code>tamuwhite</code>. In the second part of the code section, you can customize colors for frame title, title, block title, etc.</p>
<pre><code>% Some optional colors. Change or add as you see fit.
%---------------------------------------------------
\definecolor{tamumaroon}{HTML}{500000}
\definecolor{tamuwhite}{HTML}{FFFFFF}


% Some optional color adjustments to Beamer. Change as you see fit.
%------------------------------------------------------------------
\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{fg=tamuwhite,bg=tamumaroon}
\setbeamercolor{title}{fg=tamuwhite,bg=tamumaroon}
\setbeamercolor{local structure}{fg=tamumaroon}
\setbeamercolor{section in toc}{fg=tamuwhite,bg=tamumaroon}
\setbeamercolor{subsection in toc}{fg=tamuwhite,bg=tamumaroon}
\setbeamercolor{footline}{fg=tamumaroon, bg=tamuwhite}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg=tamuwhite, bg=tamumaroon}

</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Other changes I made to the template</h3>
<p>I also slightly edited the original template based on suggestions by a contributor at Stackoverflow. See the post <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64374791/page-number-not-showing-in-r-markdown-beamer-while-using-a-latex-template/64375699?noredirect=1#comment113835188_64375699">here</a>.</p>

<div id="using-the-template-in-r-markdown" class="section level3">
<h3>Using the template in R Markdown</h3>
<p>The YAML header in R Markdown would like something below. You need to specify the path where you store the template. Here I created a folder particularly for the template. Here again I use an absolute path.</p>

<p>You should set <code>keep_tex:true</code>, which will retain the LaTex file that actually creates your beamer slides. I found it’s very intuitive for troubleshooting.</p>

<h3>How to include LaTex tables in R Markdown</h3>
<p>At the end of this post, I want say something about how to include LaTex tables in beamer presentation in R Markdown.</p>
<p>According to my experience, there are two different types of tables: user-defined tables and regression result tables.</p>
<p>For the first scenario, it can be a data frame containing data or other important information that you want to present as a table in your presentation. In this case, you’d better refer to the <code>kbl</code> function from the <code>kableExtra</code> package. It has numerous features and is easy to customize based on your needs. You are highly recommended to check out this <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html#Overview">website</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p>Below I show a code example and the created table in beamer slide.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- read_csv(&#39;cutoff.csv&#39;)

df %&gt;%
  kbl(booktabs = T,caption = &#39;Estimated temperature thresholds for each of the seasons&#39;, linesep = &quot;&quot;) %&gt;%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size = 7) %&gt;% 
  footnote(general = &quot;\\\\tiny{Note: The lower threshold is restricted to be at least 5 °C above zero and 10 °C below the maximum temperature. The upper threshold is set to be at least 5 °C above the lower threshold and 5 °C below the maximum temperature. Relaxing those restrictions do not significantly change the results.}&quot;,footnote_as_chunk = T,
           threeparttable = T, escape = F,
           general_title = &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-10-17-a-latex-template-for-beamer-presentation-in-r-markdown.en_files/table1.png" /></p>
<p>Here I’d like to emphasize two more things. Firstly, the default font for table note is <code>footnote</code>. If you have a very long note, you may need change to <code>tiny</code> (see the <code>footnote</code> in the code chunk). But do REMEMBER to set the <code>escape = F</code>, otherwise the <code>\\\\tiny</code> command won’t be rendered by R Markdown.</p>
<p>Secondly, by default the footnote will be a list below the table. That means the word <code>Note:</code> will be in the row of the note. The content of the note starts at the second row. You can set <code>footnote_as_chunk = T</code> to fix this problem.</p>
<p>However, the appearance of the footnote is still wired (see the image below). Therefore, I set the <code>general_title = ""</code> to remove the default <code>Note:</code> and directly start my note with <code>Note:</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-10-17-a-latex-template-for-beamer-presentation-in-r-markdown.en_files/table2.png" /></p>
<p>To be continued for the regression result tables.</p>
