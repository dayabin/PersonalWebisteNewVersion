<h3>Why I chose blogdown to build my personal website</h3>
<p>I used to host a personal website with <code>google site</code>, which is nice and friendly to begninners. However in certain cases, google site may not be that handy. For instance, it is not compatible with <code>R markdown</code> files. You are not allowed to upload html files generated by <code>R markdown</code> to your Google site (technically you can do this by embedding the html codes, see <a href="https://www.steegle.com/google-sites/how-to/insert-custom-code">this</a>, but that’s not what I wanted).</p>
<p>So if you plan to regularly share posts (such as html files or <code>R markdown</code> files) on your website, <code>google site</code> will probably let you down. Note that <code>Markdown</code> file and <code>R markdown</code> file are not the same though very similar, see the differences explained by <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html">Yihui</a>.</p>
<p>Here comes the <code>blogdown</code> package, which is designed for building personal websites. More importantly, it is a package rooted in <code>R</code> and <code>RStuido</code> and fully compatible with other <code>R</code> components. If you are comfortable with <code>R</code> programming, <code>blogdown</code> will satisfy you.</p>

<h3>Resources for building website with blogdown</h3>
<p>There are countless resources and instructions available to guide you through step by step. See two good examples below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive instructions by <a href="https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/">Annie Lyu</a></li>
<li>A throughout instruction by <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/install/">Wowchemy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, before you hit the road, I’d like provide additional advice based on my experiences and hopefully you can benefit from it.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you are not actually “creating” a website, instead, you customize a template. For instance, the template I used is called <code>Hugo Academic</code>. A collection of templates can be found from <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">here</a>.</p>
<p>After you finish the customization, you are highly recommended to deploy your website with <code>Github</code> and <code>Netlify</code>. Should you not worry about for this, because the instructions I provided above cover the whole process in details.</p>
<p>Long story in short, you can follow <a href="https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/">Annie Lyu</a>’s instruction and customize your website on your <strong>local machine</strong> (this is the <strong>first step</strong>), and then upload your website folder to a newly created repository in <code>Github</code> (this is the <strong>second step</strong>). To do that, you can either create a new repository directly on <code>Github</code>, or you can take advantage of <code>Github Desktop</code>. The <strong>third step</strong> is to deploy using <code>Netlify</code>, which is quite straightforward.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also follow the step by step instruction by <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/install/">Wowchemy</a>, which is the official guide to create website using <code>hugo</code> (the workhourse used in the blogdown package). That means the instruction is a general cookbook and is not particularly written for <code>R blogdown</code>. For the <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/install/">Wowchemy</a> instruction, you need to set up your <code>Github</code> repository first and customize directly in <code>Github</code>. The final deploying process is similar.</p>
<p><strong>The punchline is</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are comfortable with <code>RStiduo</code> and <code>R markdown</code>, you may want to follow <a href="https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/">Annie Lyu</a>’s instruction.</li>
<li>If you are more familiar with <code>Github</code>, you can try the instruction by <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/install/">Wowchemy</a>.</li>

<h3>Potential problems with the template</h3>
<p>If you follow <a href="https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/">Annie Lyu</a>’s instruction, you may encounter problems with the <code>gcushen/hugo-academic</code> template. Remember to change the template to <code>wowchemy/starter-academic</code>. See the snapshot below.</p>

<div id="custermize-your-webiste" class="section level3">
<h3>Custermize your webiste</h3>
<p>After you complete your webiste using the template, you can move forward to custermizing the template based on your preference. To start with, follow this instruction <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/get-started/">here</a> to select a color theme and font theme for your website.</p>
<p>Then follow this <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/page-builder/">instruction</a> to custermize your homepage. You can delete unnecessary sections and create new sections based on your needs.</p>
<p>I know there are lots of stuff there but do not get yourself overwhelmed. Just try to play with it and you will be like a professional sooner or later.</p>

<div id="add-publications-to-your-website" class="section level4">
<h4>Add publications to your website</h4>
<p>You can either automatically add publications through <code>*.bib</code> BibTex files or manually add using <code>hugo</code> command. See the instruction from <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-a-publication">Wowchemy</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Automatically</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You need to create a list of your own publication and export it as a <code>*.bib</code> file. I highly recommend you do this with <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have installed the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>, that says you have <code>Python</code> installed on your computer. You can proceed by installing <code>academic</code>. To do this, open your Terminal under <code>Anaconda</code> (You can find it in the Window start menu, if you are using a Windows system), see the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../post/2020-09-24-blogdownwebsite.en_files/plot2.png" /><!-- -->
And then type the following command in the opened Terminal.</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U academic
</code></pre>
<p>Following that, use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to your website folder in the terminal.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../post/2020-09-24-blogdownwebsite.en_files/plot3.png" /><!-- --></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you will be able to import your publications with the command below.</p>
<pre><code>academic import --bibtex &lt;path_to_your/publications.bib&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>&lt;path_to_your/publications.bib&gt;</code> is the pah of your <code>bib</code> file. Do <strong>remove</strong> the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> while you are pasting the path to the terminal. See the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../post/2020-09-24-blogdownwebsite.en_files/plot4.png" /><!-- --></p></li>
<li><p>Now you should be able to see your publications in the <code>content/publication/</code> folder of your website folder.</p>
<p>Note that the command will automatically create separate folders for each of your publications.</p></li>
<li><p>In each of the publication folder, you can customize the <code>index.md</code> file based on your needs, such as adding <code>author_notes</code>, <code>tags</code>, and <code>publication_types</code>.</p>
<p><strong>To highly your name in the author list</strong>, open the <code>config\params.toml</code> file in your website folder, and set <code>highlight_superuser = true</code>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Manually</strong></p>
<p>Initially, I did not go over the approach of manually adding publications. However, later on, I figured out it’s quite useful when you have updates on your publication list such as a working paper or new publications. In these cases, the manually adding approach is handy and more convenient.
Below I follow the instruction in <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-a-publication">Wowchemy</a> and briefly show you how to do the task. It’s very simple and just one line of code.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Follow the second step in the automatically adding publication approach and open your Terminal under <code>Anaconda</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Before you type any commands in the terminal, you need to first navigate to your website folder using the <code>cd</code> command (see the second step in the automatic adding method).</p></li>
<li><p>Then you simply type the code below to add your working papers and new publications, where <code>&lt;my-publication&gt;</code> is the name of your publication, using hyphens (-) instead of spaces. Again do remember to remove the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>hugo new --kind publication publication/&lt;my-publication&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This command will automatically create a publication file in your <code>content/publication/&lt;my-publication&gt;/index.md</code> folder. You can customize and add your inputs to the <code>index.md</code>. Your updates will show up on your website after you deploy it.</p></li>
</ul>
