abstract: It is an important task for China to allocate carbon emission quotas among
  regions so as to realize its carbon reduction targets and establish the national
  cap-and-trade carbon market. Meanwhile, it is supposed to be cost-effective to jointly
  reduce China×³s carbon emissions through some collaborative activities among regions.
  Then a natural question is how to allocate the quotas among regions in light of
  the collaboration. For this purpose, the Shapley value method is adopted and the
  results show that, first, the regions with higher GDP, higher carbon outflow and
  higher carbon reduction connection should be allocated more carbon quotas. Moreover,
  when the collaboration is considered, the optimal allocation of carbon quotas among
  regions will change significantly compared to the basic quotas by the entropy method;
  and the Central region is allocated the largest proportion of carbon quota among
  regions, which indicates its largest radiation effect. Besides, the collaboration
  between the Central region and Northern coast region, and that between the Central
  region and the Eastern region should be paid close attention. These results may
  provide insightful support for decision makers to promote collaborative carbon reduction
  and allocate carbon quotas in China.
