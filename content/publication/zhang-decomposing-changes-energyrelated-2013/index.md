abstract: In order to investigate the main drivers of CO2 emissions changes in China
  during the 11th Five-Year Plan period (2006–2010) and seek the main ways to reduce
  CO2 emissions, we decompose the changes of energy-related CO2 emissions using the
  production-theoretical decomposition analysis approach. The results indicate that,
  first, economic growth and energy consumption are the two main drivers of CO2 emissions
  increase during the sample period; particularly in the northern coastal, northwest
  and central regions, where tremendous coal resources are consumed, the driving effect
  of their energy consumption on CO2 emissions appears fairly evident. Second, the
  improvement of carbon abatement technology and the reduction in energy intensity
  play significant roles in curbing carbon emissions, and comparatively the effect
  of carbon abatement technology proves more significant. Third, energy use technical
  efficiency, energy use technology and carbon abatement technical efficiency have
  only slight influence on CO2 emissions overall. In the end, we put forward some
  policy recommendations for China’s government to reduce CO2 emissions intensity
  in the future.
