abstract: 'Flood disaster has become one of the most damaging natural disasters for
  the highway transportation all around the world, especially its destructive effects
  on highway infrastructures. In order to better understand the ruinous influence
  of flood disaster on highway transportation in China, this paper proposes an alternative
  evaluation index of highway flood disaster risk from three aspects, namely the disaster-causing
  factors, disaster-inducing environment, and disaster-bearing subjects. This paper
  also puts forward some targeted suggestions for the risk management, including two
  aspects: physical protection measurement and organization and management measurement.
  Moreover, this paper develops a highway flood disaster risk management system by
  using the ArcGIS technology.'
