abstract: In order to find the efficient ways to reduce carbon emission intensity
  in China, we utilize the LMDI method to decompose the changes of China×³s carbon
  emissions and carbon emission intensity from 1996 to 2010, from the perspectives
  of energy sources and industrial structure respectively. Then we introduce the decoupling
  index to analyze the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions and economic
  growth in China. The results indicate that, on the one hand, economic growth appeared
  as the main driver of carbon emissions increase in the past decades, while the decrease
  of energy intensity and the cleaning of final energy consumption structure played
  significant roles in curbing carbon emissions; meanwhile, the secondary industry
  proved the principal source of carbon emissions reduction among the three industries
  and had relatively higher potential. On the other hand, when the decoupling relationship
  is considered, most years during the study period saw the relative decoupling effect
  between carbon emissions and economic growth, which indicated that the reduction
  effect of inhibiting factors of carbon emissions was less than the driving effect
  of economic growth, and the economy grew with increased carbon emissions; there
  appeared the absolute decoupling effect in 1997, 2000 and 2001, which implied that
  the economy grew while carbon emissions decreased; whereas no decoupling effect
  was identified in 2003 and 2004.
