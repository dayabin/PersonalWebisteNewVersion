abstract: 'Little attention has been given to the carbon emissions issues of ‘Belt
  and Road Initiative’ countries although most countries have set explicit targets
  for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Taking advantage of the production
  theory, distance function, and data envelopment analysis, we employed a production-theoretical
  decomposition analysis to decompose the total carbon dioxide emission changes of
  the “Belt and Road Initiatives” countries from 2000 to 2014 into the contribution
  of seven driving factors and focused particularly on a production technology perspective.
  The main findings are as follows: (1) the economic development as proxied by the
  gross domestic product and the potential carbon emissions related to energy consumption
  were the two most important factors affecting carbon emission growth. The driving
  factor values for these two factors were 1.989 and 1.37. The average CO2 emissions
  of the “Belt and Road Initiatives” countries in 2014 were 1.425 times larger than
  those in 2000. (2) The carbon abatement technology changes and potential energy
  intensity changes were the two main inhibiting factors return with factor values
  of 0.775 and 0.793. Moreover, we divided all countries into four groups, namely
  China and three other groups based on the income level. The results showed that
  the three groups had similar characteristics in terms of the carbon abatement technology
  effect and the carbon dioxide abatement technological efficiency, whereas China
  exhibited larger fluctuations. The promoting effect of economic development is significantly
  higher in China than in the other three groups. In addition, this promoting effect
  exhibited a decrease over time, indicating a decoupling between economic development
  and CO2 emissions.'
