<p>This post documents interesting sources for world-level, country-level, and sub-national level (i.e., states/provinces, cities, counties, etc) maps (administrative areas) data. It could be particularly useful when you are trying to downscale gridded data to specific geographical levels in spatial analysis.</p>
<div id="database-of-global-administrative-areas-gadm" class="section level1">
<h1>Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM)</h1>
<p><a href="https://gadm.org/">GADM</a> provides maps and spatial data for all countries and their sub-divisions. You can browse the maps or download the data to make your own maps.</p>
<p>See an example of spatial data for China. Level-0, 1, 2, 3 stands for country level, province level, city level, and county level I guess. But you should double check that.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://gadm.org/formats.html">data</a> package for more information in data format.</p>

<h1>Natural Earth</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a> is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.</p>
<p>This dataset provides vector data at country-level, state-level, and populated places and obviously, is not as detailed as in GADM. <strong>But it pretty suitable for ploting at the the worldwide level</strong>. Natural Earth also provides vector data on coasline, land, ocean, reefs, rivers, lakes, etc, as well as raster data.</p>
