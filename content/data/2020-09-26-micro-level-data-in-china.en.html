<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This section is designated to summerize commonly used mirco data for China. Most of the data were collected through surveys conducted by government and universities. I will update this document when I find new data sources in the literature. I will also attach papers that adpoted these data set.</p>
<p>Note that Chinese National Survey Data Arhive provides plenty of mrico-data. Most of the dataset below can be accessed there. See the <a href="http://cnsda.ruc.edu.cn/index.php">website</a> for details.</p>
<p>The Open Research Data Platform of Peking University holds the China Survey Data Archive, from which you might find some data that are not commonly used. See the <a href="https://opendata.pku.edu.cn/dataverse/CSDA">website</a> for details.</p>

<li><p>Summary of data</p>
<p>China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) is a nationally representative, annual longitudinal survey of Chinese communities, families, and individuals launched in 2010 by the Institute of Social Science Survey (ISSS) of Peking University, China. The CFPS is designed to collect individual-, family-, and community-level longitudinal data in contemporary China. The studies focus on the economic, as well as the non-economic, wellbeing of the Chinese population, with a wealth of information covering such topics as economic activities, education outcomes, family dynamics and relationships, migration, and health. The CFPS is funded by the Chinese government through Peking University. The CFPS promises to provide to the academic community the most comprehensive and highest-quality survey data on contemporary China. Three key features of the CFPS are worth noting here.</p></li>

<p>In 2017, SDC successfully implemented the 10th wave of RUMiC. In this wave, a Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system replaced the traditional paper-and-pencil method and significantly improved data quality. In 2018 and 2019, all households participating in the 2016 or 2017 waves were interviewed by phone using the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system, successfully tracing about 3,000 and nearly 2,500 households, respectively.</p></li>

<h2><strong>China Education Panel Survey</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Year of survey</p>
<p>Currently 2013-2014, ongoing, will last for over 30 years</p></li>
<li><p>Summary of data</p>
<p>The China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) is a large-scale, nationally representative, longitudinal survey starting with two cohorts – the 7th and 9th graders in the 2013-2014 academic year. Documenting educational processes and transitions by which students progress through various educational stages, the CEPS aims at explaining the linkages between individuals’ educational outcomes and multiple contexts of families, school processes, communities and social structure, and further studying the effects of educational outcomes during people’s life course.</p>
<p>The CEPS applies a stratified, multistage sampling design with probability proportional to size (PPS), randomly selecting a school-based, nationally representative sample of approximately 20,000 students in 438 classrooms of 112 schools in 28 county-level units in mainland China. The baseline survey of CEPS was completed in the 2013-2014 academic year, conducted by National Survey Research Center (NSRC) at Renmin University of China. The data are currently available for academic research. Follow-up surveys are annual as the sample adolescents matriculate throughout the junior-high stage and in the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 8th, 17th and 27th year after they graduate from junior-high. CEPS will last more than 30 years, during which a new cohort of 7th graders will be started in a 10-year interval.</p>
<p>The student questionnaire includes topics such as students’ demographic characteristics, mobility and migration status, childhood experience, health status, household structure, parent-child interactions, in-school performance, extra curricular activities, relationship with teachers and peers, social behavior development, and expectations for the future.</p>
<p>Parent questionnaire consists of questions about parents’ demographic characteristics and lifestyles, parent-child interactions, educational environment and investment for child, community environment, parent-teacher interactions, and parents’ perceptions of school education and expectations for the future of the child.</p>
<p>Information on homeroom, teach characteristics, school administrators are also provided.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Chinese Household Income Project</strong></h2>

<li><p>Year of survey</p>
<p>1989, 1996, 2003, 2008, and 2013 covering income and expenditure information in 1988, 1995, 2002, 2007, and 2013, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Summary of data</p>
<p>To track the dynamics of income distribution in China, the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) has conducted five waves of household surveys, in 1989, 1996, 2003, 2008 and 2013. They covered the income and expenditure information in 1988, 1995, 2002, 2007 and 2013 respectively and called CHIP1988, CHIP1995, CHIP2002, CHIP2007, and CHIP2013.</p>
<p>All the CHIP waves contain surveys of urban and rural households. In view of the increased importance of rural-to-urban migration, and because the urban and rural household subsamples do not adequately cover migrants, the 2002 survey added a survey of rural-to-urban migrants. Thus, the 2002 CHIP survey includes three subsamples. The same procedure was adopted for the 2007 survey, which is also composed of three parts: the urban household survey, the rural household survey, and the rural-to-urban migrant household survey. This structure reflects China’s urban-rural division and the increased number of rural individuals who have migrated into the urban areas, especially during the last two decades.</p>
<p><strong>Note that this data set includes data on rural-to-urban migration for year 2002, 2008, and 2009. The migration data should be consistent with the <em>Rural-Urban Migration in China</em> which is also introduced in this collection. </strong></p></li>
