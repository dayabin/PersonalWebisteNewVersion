<div id="maca-projected" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>MACA (projected)</strong></h2>
<p>Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) is a statistical method for downscaling Global Climate Models (GCMs) from their native coarse resolution to a higher spatial resolution that reflects observed patterns of daily near-surface meteorology and simulated changes in GCMs experiments. This method has been shown to be slightly preferable to direct daily interpolated bias correction in regions of complex terrain due to its use of a historical library of observations and multivariate approach.</p>
<p>The dataset embraces 20 CMIP5 GCMs that provided daily output for historical (1950-2005) and future projections (2006-2100) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. See its <a href="https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/index.php">website</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coverage: The Contiguous United States</li>
<li>Temporal resolution: Daily</li>
<li>Spatial resolution: 4km * 4km (1/25 degree)</li>
<li>Variables: Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, maximum daily relative humidity, minimum, average daily specific humidity near surface, average daily precipitation, average daily downward shortwave radiation, average daily wind speed, average daily eastward component of wind, and average daily northward component of wind.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note that</strong> Although the dataset has performed bias-corrections, these corrections are just to downscale the GCMs outputs to high-resolution data. When these data are used in empirical climate change assessments, they cannot be directly compared with historical observations that are used to estimate your model. This will cause inconsistency because you are comparing GCMs-based data with observed data. Instead, you have to compare the GCMs-based projected data with GCMs-based historical data and calculate the changes (i.e., delta).</p>

<div id="air-pollution-data" class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Air pollution data</strong></h1>
<p>While the focus of this post is climate data and natural disaster data, I will also try to cover some air pollution data. Empirically, we would prefer “real” air pollution data, i.e., readings from monitor stations. The problem is that those data are usually not consistent in spatial and temporal scales. For instance, monitors tend to be placed in urban areas with high pollution density, whereas monitors in rural areas are pretty limited. Also due to regular maintenance and unexpected events, monitors may miss records to a large extent.</p>
<p>To address the above concerns, practitioners could turn to model-based air pollution data. An alternative is <a href="https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/">MERRA-2</a> which contains a long list of air pollutants that are available at a wide variety of spatial and temporal resolutions.</p>
<p>Besides the model-generated data, I will also cover alternative data sources, especially those featuring machine learning. A recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019300650?via%3Dihub#!">study</a> integrates multiple machine learning algorithms and predictor variables (i.e., satellite data, meteorological variables, land-use variables, chemical transport model predictions, reanalysis datasets, etc.) to estimate daily PM2.5 at a resolution of 1km * 1km across the contiguous United States.</p>

<div id="em-dat-a-complete-dataset-for-disasters" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>EM-DAT: A complete dataset for disasters</strong></h2>
<p>This database documents a long list of many disasters <strong>globally</strong>, including natural disasters, technological disaster (i.e., transport accident, industrial accident, etc.), and complex disaster (i.e., famine).</p>
<p>The database has several levels of data entry. The disaster level records general information about the disaster, including its type (i.e., earthquake, storm, flood, etc.) and group (i.e., geophysical, meteorological, hydrological, etc.). The county-level provides information on the specific location of the disaster and the temporal information (i.e., starting and ending date) as well as the magnitude scale of the disaster. Level three data provide the source of information, human impact, and economic impacts.</p>
<p>Note that the disasters are collected into the database if they meet one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deaths: 10 or more people deaths</p></li>
<li><p>Affected: 100 or more people affected/injured/homeless.</p></li>
<li><p>Declaration/international appeal: Declaration by the country of a state of emergency and/or an appeal for international assistance.</p></li>

<h2><strong>International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)</strong></h2>
<p>IBTrACS is the most complete global collection of tropical cyclones available. It creates a unified, publicly available, best-track dataset that improves inter-agency comparisons. IBTrACS was developed collaboratively with all the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres, as well as other organizations and individuals from around the world, and is maintained by NOAA.</p>
<p>See its <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive">page</a> for more information.</p>
<p>There are three key variables in the dataset: Maximum sustained wind speed (in knots), minimum central pressure (in mb), and storm center of circulation (in degrees lat/lon). The data are recorded at a temporal resolution of 3 hourly and a spatial resolution of 0.1 degree (~10 km). It documents events even back to 1920s. But data are more reliable after 1950s.</p>
<p>The data are provided in the format of CSV, netCDF, and shapefiles.</p>

Significant smoke plumes that are detected by the satellites are outlined by the analyst as well as an estimate of the smoke concentration provided. This product is created and updated as needed between 1 PM and 11 PM Eastern time. After 11 PM the analysis is fine-tuned as time permits. The graphical HMS product is finalized once daily.</p>

<h2><strong>Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The Landsat NDVI</strong> is one of the most widely used vegetation index. It is produced from Landsat 4–5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8-9 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) Collection 1 and Collection 2 scenes that have been processed to Landsat Level-2 Surface Reluctance products. NDVI is used to quantify vegetation greenness and is useful in understanding vegetation density and assessing changes in plant health. See this <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-normalized-difference-vegetation-index#:~:text=NDVI%20is%20used%20to%20quantify,">link</a>%20%2F%20(NIR%20%2B%20R)) for more details.</p>
<p>Besides the NDVI product, the USGS also hosts other widely used data sets, including Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). See <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-surface-reflectance-derived-spectral-indices">here</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Normally, we use data the Level-3 (also known as Level-2 Science Products, Analysis Ready Data in USGS), such as Landsat Surface Reluctance, Landsat Surface Temperature, Landsat Surface Reluctance-Derived Spectral Indices (vegetation, moisture index, etc.).</p>

<h2><strong>NOAA Vegetation Products</strong></h2>
<p>The Office of Satellite And Product Operations at NoAA provides a list of vegetation products at various spatial (4km, 1km) and temporal levels (daily, weekly, bi-weekly), including Vegetation Index (VI), Green Vegetation Fraction (GVF), Vegetation Health Product (VVHP), and VIIRS Surface Reluctance (NDVI). See the <a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/vegetation.html">link</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Importantly</strong>, The Office of Satellite And Product Operations at NoAA also provides other satellite-based data, specifically Atmosphere Products (Aerosol, Precipitation, Clouds, Winds, Volcanic Ash, Ozone, Soundings, etc), Imagery Products, Land Products (Fire and Smoke, Surface and Hydrology, Snow and Ice, Vegetation), Ocean Products (Coral Bleaching, Ocean Heat Content, Marine Pollution, Sea Surface Temperature, Ocean Color, Sea Surface Temperature).</p>
