This post documents an interesting source for sub-national level administrative areas, such as city-level shapefiles. This could be particularly useful when you are trying to downscale gridded data to city-level. 

The database is [GADM](https://gadm.org/) (Database of Global Administrative Areas). It provides maps and spatial data for all countries and their sub-divisions. You can browse our maps or download the data to make your own maps.

See an example of spatial data for China. Level-0, 1, 2, 3 stands for county level, province level, city level, and county level I guess. But you should double check that.
